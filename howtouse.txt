In the development environment in the terminal, execute the commands:
1) If you don't have Python installed, do it. In most cases, a Python installation is sufficient!
2) npm i
3) gulp

Possible problems with gulp and solutions:

1) After updating SASS, you may sometimes need to run the command:
npm rebuild node-sass

2) If after installing Python in the terminal log there are errors related to its libraries, run the command:
npm install --global windows-build-tools

3) For problems with imagemin::
- Folders and files must be named in Latin letters without spaces;
- The img tag and its content must be written on one line without hyphenation;
- The src attribute must contain the path to a real image.
